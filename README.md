An e-commerce website consisting of two different pages. A home page that can be scaled to be a fully functional website that can pull thousands of different books off the internet. 
With the second page being a library that one can sort through. The second page contains JavaScript best practices in which I have implemented a skeleton loading state, optimal filtering algorithms, image caching, and lazing loading.
